```C++
char str1[]={"123"};
// actual storage: 1 2 3 '\0' 
// the '\0' at the end was added automatically by the compiler
// so normally we don't need to assign string length when initializing

// However, when the length of string is not enough:
char str1[3]={"123"};
// there is no way to add the '\0' to the end, because there's just no place for it
// Also, if every char is quoted, the '\0' will also be lost:
char str1[]={'1', '2', '3'};

// So if we want to have that '\0', there are three ways to write this:
char str1[]={"123"};
char str1[]={'1', '2', '3', '\0'};
char str1[4]={'1', '2', '3'};  // preserve a space for the '\0'
```
